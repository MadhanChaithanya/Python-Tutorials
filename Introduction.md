Python History:
---------------
Guido van Rossum is the inventor of Python Programming Language, he worked as an implementer on a team building a 
language called ABC at "Centrum Wiskunde Informatica" (CWI). 

In the year 1989, he started to prepare a Simple Scripting Language to resolve the problems of ABC programming language, 
as part of this, he prepared a simple virtual machine, a simple parser, and a simple runtime with 
various parts of ABC programming Language.

Guido van Rossum has given name to this programming Language as "Python" not by thinking Snakes name, 
he has given name "Python" to the programming language as he is a big fan of "Monty Python's Flying Circus" TV Show. 

Guido van Rossum has introduced the first version of Python in February 1991 with the Version 0.9.0 with the features 
like Exception Handling, Functions, and the core data types of list, dict, str and so on.

Python version 1.0 was released in January 1994, It includes the major new features like functional programming tools 
like lambda, map, filter and reduce,....

In October 2000, Python 2.0 was introduced, It has included the features like list comprehensions, a full garbage collector 
and supporting unicode.....

In December 2008, Python 3.0 version was introduced , it is also called as 
“Python 3000” or “Py3K”, it includes the following enhancements.

1. Print is now a function
2. Views and iterators instead of lists
3. The rules for ordering comparisons have been simplified.
4. There is only one integer type left, i.e. int. long is int as well.
5. The division of two integers returns a float instead of an integer.
6. Text Vs. Data Instead Of Unicode Vs. 8-bit
and some other Syntax changes.

Note: Python 3.0 version is not backward Compatible with Python 2.0 version.

The latest Version of the Python is "Python 3.7.3" released in 29th Mar 2019.
